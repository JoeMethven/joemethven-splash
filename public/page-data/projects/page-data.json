Merlin Panel is an all-in-one solution for businesses to manage their online presence. \n\nThis fully comprehensive platform can handle eCommerce (automated shipping prices, stock control, dynamic discounts), Website Editor (powered by Git), User Management, LiveChat, Network/DNS Management, Social Media Analytics/Management, Custom Form Creator and more.\n\nThe architecture consists of a large but simple Node/Express REST API powering the main React/Redux panel. Each individual client website is deployed via API > GitHub > Netlify. My MongoDB system allows for multiple databases to be accessed by the API seamlessly. The server-less client approach means the client websites cannot go down; scalability is a key focus on this architecture. \n\nEverything from monthly subscription billing and eCommerce (with autorize.net, Stripe and Braintree), to Pixel and SEO integration has been considered.

All collections were stored in a sharded MongoDB server. The frontend was rebuilt using React/Redux and built off of an Ant Design CSS framework. I also created an internal admin portal in React/Redux as well.\n\nThe latest stages involves QA Automation such as Mocha/Chai CircleCI reports on Git pull requests and Jest/Percy tests in React.

I was given a £20,000 budget to build and MVP to showcase to investors in three months. \n\nI hired another developer to assist me on developing the MVP. Together we built a website powered in Node, SCSS, Bootstrap, Express and MongoDB. This allowed SMB to secure $120,000 in funding to further progress the company over the next 6 months.
